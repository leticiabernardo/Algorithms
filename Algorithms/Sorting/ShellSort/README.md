# Shell Sort

Shell Sort is essentially a variation of Insertion Sort and can be seen as a generalization of bubble sort. In insertion sorting, we move the elements only one position in front. When an element needs to be moved very much to the front, many moves are necessary. The idea of the Shell Sort is to allow the swapping of remote items. <br />
The method instead of breaking the list into sublists of adjacent items, the shell sort uses an increment i, sometimes called a gap, to create a sublist by picking all items that are i items away from each other.
