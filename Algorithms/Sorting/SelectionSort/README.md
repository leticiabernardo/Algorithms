# Selection Sort

Sorting by selection is a very easy sorting algorithm. <br />
It starts by putting the first item of the array as a pivot and it iterates over the entire array, checking to see if the pivot is smaller than the item. If it is higher, it switches locations. And it does this consecutively, for each item in the list.
