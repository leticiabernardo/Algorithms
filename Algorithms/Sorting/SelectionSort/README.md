# Selection Sort

Sorting by selection is a very easy sorting algorithm. <br />
It starts by putting the first item of the array as a pivot and it iterates over the entire array, checking to see if the pivot is smaller than the item. If it is higher, it switches locations. <br />
And it does this consecutively, for each item in the list.
