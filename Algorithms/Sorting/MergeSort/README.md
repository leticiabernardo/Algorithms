# Merge Sort

Created in 1945 by American mathematician John Von Neumann, Mergesort is an example of a sorting algorithm that makes use of the "divide and conquer" strategy to solve problems.<br />

This algorithm divides the problem into smaller pieces, solves each one, and then merge the outputs together.<br />
