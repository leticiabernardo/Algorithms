# Merge Sort

Created in 1945 by American mathematician John Von Neumann, Mergesort is an example of a sorting algorithm that makes use of the "divide and conquer" strategy to solve problems.<br />

The Merge Sort is a recursive algorithm that divides a list into two parts continuously. If the list is empty or has a single item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called merge sorting, is performed. Merge sorting is the process of taking two smaller sorted lists and combining them to form a new, single, sorted list.<br />
See the merge sorting example below:
