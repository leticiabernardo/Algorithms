# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is the simplest algorithm, but the least efficient.<br />
This algorithm repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. That is, each element of position i will be compared with the element of position i + 1, that is, an element of position 2 will be compared with the element of position 3.<br />
If the element at position 2 is larger than the element at position 3, they swap places, and so on.<br />
Thus, the array will need to be passed through as many times as necessary until the list is sorted.
