# Radix Sort

Radix sort is a sorting algorithm that uses the digit-by-digit sorting method, 
in which it sorts elements by first pooling the single digits of the same positional value. 
Then sort the elements based on their ascending/descending order.
<br />

## How it works

Let's take, for example, the array below:<br />

<p align="center">

</p>



To sort them by the Radix Sort method, the following steps can be followed.
- Step 1 - Sort by units.
- Step 2 - Sort by tens.
- Step 3 - Sort by hundreds.

And so on. In the end the array will be sorted.

</p>

**Ps.:** When some value is empty, we can assume it as zero or even empty, and it must always come first.
