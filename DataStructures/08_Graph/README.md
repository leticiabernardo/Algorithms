# Graph

In computer science, a Graph is a non-linear data structure of one or more pairs of sets that consist of nodes and edges.<br />
The graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are also used in social networks such as Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a node. Each node stores a structure that contains information such as the person's ID, name, etc.
<br />
Another example is the routes of airplanes between airports, using graphs we can determine routes from point X to point Y. <br />
See the example below:

</p>

In this example we can see routes from Canada and Chile to Brazil, but there are no direct routes from France and Italy to Brazil.


## Terminology

- **Nodes**: can also be called vertices or points. Node store structures and information.
- **Edges**: are the connection between two nodes.

Example 2:

</p>

In the above graph have with five vertices and six edges.

The set of vertices: V = {A, B, C, D, E} and the set of edges E = {AB, AB, BD, BE, DE}.<br />
